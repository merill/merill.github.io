I'm a Product Manager at Microsoft in the Microsoft Entra, Customer Acceleration Team (CAT). In my day job I help some of Microsoft's largest enterprise customers deploy Microsoft Entra succesfully. I also collaborate with product and engineering teams on new Microsoft Entra features with a focus on the Identity side of Microsoft Graph.

In my free time I like to build tools and apps to help the community and also share my knowledge through social media. Below you can find some of the things I've built and contributed to.
