<p>It’s been nearly four months since I moved to Melbourne and having been in Sydney six months prior, Melbourne was indeed a welcome change.</p>  <p>Although it’s very easy to forget how beautiful it is here. My favorite part of the daily commute is the ten minute walk through Fawkner Park (named after Melbourne’s co-founder).</p>  <p>Here’s a bird’s eye view of Fawkner park.</p>  <p><a href="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Melbourne_7AF3/Fawkner-Park_2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img title="Fawkner-Park" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="480" alt="Fawkner-Park" src="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Melbourne_7AF3/Fawkner-Park_thumb.jpg" width="380" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>A few from today’s morning walk.</p>  <p><a href="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Melbourne_7AF3/IMG_0662.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img title="IMG_0662" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="480" alt="IMG_0662" src="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Melbourne_7AF3/IMG_0662_thumb.jpg" width="640" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Melbourne_7AF3/IMG_0663.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img title="IMG_0663" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="348" alt="IMG_0663" src="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Melbourne_7AF3/IMG_0663_thumb.jpg" width="640" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>On sunny days we grab our lunch and head downstairs to have it at the park. It’s no wonder Melboune has consistently been at the top spot in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Most_Livable_Cities">World’s Most Livable Cities</a> list over the years.</p>
