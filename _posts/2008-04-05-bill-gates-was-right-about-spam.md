<p>In 2004 BillG made a statement that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/24/tech/main595595.shtml">spam will be solved in two years</a>. In 2008 I can prove that it is. </p> <p>Here's how my Inbox looks today.</p> <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="174" alt="Inbox" src="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/binary/BillGateswasrightaboutspam_10B97/Inbox.jpg" width="117" border="0"> </p> <p>That's 19,326 spam message caught in the last 30 days. Not a single spam slipped through and nothing was falsely flagged. </p> <p>What he wouldn't be happy about though is that it wasn't his team that solved it but the guys over at GMail.</p> <p>The Windows Live Mail client, unfortunately, flags my own messages as Junk.</p>
