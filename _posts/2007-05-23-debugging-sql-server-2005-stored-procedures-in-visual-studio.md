<p>I used to use the debug feature in Query Analyzer when working with SQL Server 2000 quite a lot. There were a number of time when I did want to do this in SQL Server 2005 but couldn't quite figure it out. I looked high and low on SQL Server Management Studio to no avail.</p> <p>The reason? Debugging was moved out of SQL Server Management Studio and into Visual Studio.</p> <p><img height="410" alt="Debug SQL Server Stored Procedure" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/binary/DebuggingSQLServer2005StoredProceduresin_713C/sqlserver2005Debugstoredprocedure4.gif" width="363"> </p> <p>Read all about it in this <a href="http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/051607-1.aspx">article</a> by Scott Mitchell.</p>
