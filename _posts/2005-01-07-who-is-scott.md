<P>One of my former colleagues Nadeera forwarded this mail to me, I wonder how authentic it is?</SPAN></P>
<P>You must have always wondered why the username / password in SQL is Scott/Tiger....</SPAN></P>
<P>Who is this Scott? Here is the answer to your query....</SPAN></P>
<P>So,&nbsp; who is Scott?</SPAN></P>
<P>Bruce Scott was one of the first employees at Oracle (then&nbsp; Software Development Laboratories). He co-founded Gupta Technology (now known as Centura Software) in 1984 with Umang Gupta, and later became CEO and founder of&nbsp; PointBase, Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P>Bruce was co-author and co-architect of Oracle V1, V2&nbsp; and V3.</SPAN></P>
<P>The SCOTT schema (EMP and DEPT tables), with password TIGER, was&nbsp; created by him. Tiger was the name of his cat.</SPAN></P></DIV>
