<p>Dhammika from <a href="http://www.zone24x7.com/home/index.htm">zone24x7</a> just forwarded this ad to me. They&rsquo;re looking for Software Engineers and Web Developers, click on the thumbnail below to see the full ad.</p>
<p>I personally know a handful of&nbsp;the guys who work here. Starting with Dhammika (a brilliant mind) who worked with me at GBS (now <a href="http://www.atlantisonetech.com/">AOT</a>), Kanchana (she started the first QA unit at Virtusa) who also worked at GBS and Shoba one of my M.Sc. batch mates. Definitely a good place to work at.</p>
