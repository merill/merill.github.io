<p><img height="300" alt="Imara &amp; Rafael" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/binary/Rafael_E6AE/ImaraRafael.jpg" width="400"> </p> <p>It turned out to be a wonderful coincidence that our second son Rafael decided to be born on our second wedding anniversary!</p> <p>The little fella has a loud voice and wakes his older brother up at night, but we all love him so much.</p> <p>Having a baby so many miles away from family and friends should have been a very difficult experience. On the contrary the midwives who delivered Rafael were so friendly and motherly that Imara, Joshua and I never felt any stress.</p> <p>I'm even more impressed by the fact that the midwives visit our house to check on the mother and baby and the constant care given. The Australian medical system by far would have to be one of the best in the world.</p> <p>Anyway's my mother in law just flew in from Sri Lanka today so that's going to make it a little more easier for Imara.</p>
