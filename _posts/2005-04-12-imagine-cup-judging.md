<p>With all the work going on at office, I didn&rsquo;t have much time on my hands to be doing any posting. Anyway this post is way overdue and goes back to the 25th of March when two industry heavy-weights, Duminda Ratnayaka (CEO of&nbsp;Celltel, a visionary who&nbsp;launched the first mobile company in Sri Lanka way back in the early 90s), Dr. Emerick Fernando (another great guy who once used to work at Microsoft&nbsp;and was also CEO of Global Software Labs in Colombo) along with&nbsp;a bunch of MVPs (<a href="http://thedeveloper.blogspot.com/">Prasanna</a> and <a href="http://www.welasharp.net/">Wela</a>) and Ed&nbsp;Quek from Microsoft Singapore got together to judge the best teams for the Imaging Cup.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the four teams who made it to the final round of the Sri Lankan leg. One of these teams will be the ultimate winner and will be representing Sri Lanka in the worldwide competitions in Japan.</p>
