<p>If like me you frequently send money back to Sri Lanka, it's important to know how to play the game.</p> <p>You can save yourself some dollars or rupees by knowing if things are going up or down, here's where <a href="http://www.x-rates.com">x-rates.com</a> comes to help.</p> <p>Pick the two currencies from where your sending and receiving and hey presto you have a graph.</p> <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="246" alt="LKRAUD-conversion" src="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/WindowsLiveWriter/Playingthecurrencygame_ED2E/LKRAUD-conversion_1.jpg" width="430" border="0"> </p> <p>I for one will be waiting a couple more days before my next transfer.</p> <p>Oh and I nearly forgot, the guys at <a href="http://www.ceylincofastcash.com/">Ceylinco Fast Cash</a> give a really good service when sending money home. My last transfer went through like a breeze, in less than one hour, I deposited some money in Sydney and my brother withdrew from Colombo. Both of us were SMS'd every step of the way by their automated system. </p> <p>Plus if you use there service about 6 times they provide a number of free benefits including a "doctor on call and other medical services for your loved ones in Sri Lanka".</p>
