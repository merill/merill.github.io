<p>An excellent <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/10/knocking_the_ex.html">post</a> by Kathy, here&rsquo;s an extract:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>In an earlier post I said, <i>"If you asked the head of a company which employee they'd prefer: the perfect team player who doesn't rock the boat or the one who is brave enough to stand up and fight for something rather than accept the watered-down group think that maintains the status quo (or makes things worse), who would they SAY they'd choose? Who would they REALLY choose?</I></P>
<P>In his book Re-imagine", <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/" target="_blank">Tom Peters</a> says, "We will win this battle... and the larger war... only when our talent pool is both deep and broad. Only when our organizations are chock-a-block with obstreperous people who are determined to bend the rules at every turn..."</p>
<p>So yes, I'm thinking Mr. CEO of Very Large Company would say that their company should take the upstart whatever-it-takes person over the ever-compromising team player. "If that person shakes us up, gets us to rethink, creates a little tension, well that's a Good Thing", the CEO says. riiiiiiiiiight. While I believe most CEOs do think this way, wow, that attitude reverses itself quite dramatically the futher you reach down the org chart. There's a canyon-sized gap between what company heads say they want (brave, bold, innovative) and what their own middle management seems to prefer (yes-men, worker bees, team players).
