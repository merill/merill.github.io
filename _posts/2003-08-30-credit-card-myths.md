A really good article on credit card myths from <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/21/192635/540">kuro5hin</a>.
I'm publishing the complete text here.

<b>"Credit Cards Are Expensive"</b>

This should not be the case at all -- credit cards can in fact be entirely free. I
certainly don't pay anything at all to my credit card company beyond what I actually
charge on the card (plus the cost of a stamp to mail payment for the bill), and there's
no reason you should either.

There are of course some expenses one <i>could</i> incur through unwise use of credit
cards, but these are fairly easily avoided:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Yearly Fees</b>: These can range from $50/year to over $400/year (for some fancy
American Express Platinum cards). These may be worth it for some of the high-end cards
like American Express that come with many ancillary services, but if all you want
is a credit card, don't pay any yearly fees. Keep reading those offers as they come
in, and you're bound to find plenty of cards that have no yearly fee. Many Visa and
MasterCard issuers charge no yearly fee, and American Express's "Blue" card does not
either.</li>
 	<li><b>Interest</b>: This is the biggest problem with people's use of credit cards, but
is again easily avoided. Simply treat your credit card as if it were a bill that must
be paid, and ignore the "credit" part of the name. When you buy things on it, pretend
it was a debit card or cash, and only spend money you actually have. Then pay the
bill in full when it comes, and you'll pay no interest at all.A word of warning, however: that there are some unscrupulous credit card companies
with whom this is not possible. Before signing up for a card, carefully read the terms
to make sure there is a "grace period" (generally 14-21 days). If there is, you can
pay the bill within this period and incur no interest at all. A few cards lack grace
periods; with these you pay interest starting from the date of purchase (not the date
the bill is sent), regardless of whether you pay the bill on time or not. Avoid these
cards.</li>
</ul>
The summary to using a credit card for free: Get a card with no annual fee and at
least a 14-day grace period. Then pay your bills on time, and you'll never pay anything
more than your bill.

<b>"Credit Cards are Insecure"</b>

This is simply untrue. In the United States at least, there are strong protections
in place for cardholders.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Theft</b>: Under US law, the cardholder is responsible for no more than $50 of
charges made to a stolen card, even if the theft isn't reported right away and thousands
of dollars have been charged in the meantime. Timely reporting can even avoid this
$50, as the holder is not responsible for any charges at all made after the card is
reported stolen (it's considered the responsibility of the credit card company to
deactivate the account as soon as it's reported stolen). Some credit card companies,
especially "Platinum" level cards, also waive the $50 and take full responsibility
for any charges to a stolen card. Furthermore, the $50 only applies if you physically
lose your card -- if someone steals your number but not the physical card, you're
not responsible for any charges. But in any case, by law $50 is the absolute maximum
you can possibly lose from a stolen card.</li>
 	<li><b>Fraud</b>: The credit card dispute-resolution procedures are heavily tilted in
favor of the cardholder. Simply registering a dispute automatically puts the charge
on hold, and you don't have to pay it until the dispute is resolved. The burden of
proof in resolution is primarily on the charger, not the cardholder -- they must produce
evidence that the charge was authorized by the cardholder, and that the services paid
for were rendered. This is a notorious complaint of anti-spam ISPs (they almost never
succeed in collecting on their "we'll charge your card $500 in spam clean-up fees
if you spam from our account"), but it works well for cardholders. You're doubly protected
online, because the credit card companies require a higher standard of evidence from
the charging party in cases where they don't actually have the cardholder's signature
on the transaction. If you are in deep trouble and can't seem to find the solution , perhaps this <a href="https://creditguide.io/credit-repair-companies/">list of credit repair companies</span></a> will help you.</li>
</ul>
<b>But Why Not Just Use Debit?</b>

There's quite a few reasons I consider a credit card, when properly used, to be preferable
to a debit card.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Fraud and Disputes:</b> With a credit card, disputing a charge automatically puts
it on hold, and you don't pay pending resolution of the dispute. With a debit card,
your money has already been debited, and you generally don't get it back until the
dispute has been resolved in your favor. If the disputed amount is large, being out
the money for the weeks it takes to resolve a dispute may be undesirable.</li>
 	<li><b>Security:</b> If you lose an ATM or Debit card and report it within 2 days, you're
covered under the same $50 limit as with credit cards. However, if you don't notice
for 3 days, the limit becomes $500. There is the added security of a PIN number to
balance this, but in the US at least, this can easily be circumvented with most cards
by simply using the debit card through the credit card charging system (e.g. by making
online orders, which generally don't ask for PIN numbers). With a credit card, you
can never be out more than $50. With a debit card, you could well be out $500 if you
don't notice for three days, and someone has gone nuts on newegg.com in the meantime.
And, as with the disputes, there's also the issue of who fronts the money in the interim.
When you report a credit card stolen, all the charges are put on hold. When you report
a debit card stolen, you don't get your money back right away, until the "stolen card"
procedures and paperwork are completed. So even if your liability ends up being only
$50 (or $500), you could be out the entire balance of your bank account in the interim.</li>
 	<li><b>Financial benefits</b>:
<ul>
 	<li>Delayed payments: Credit cards on average let you keep your money for around two weeks
before you actually have to pay for your purchase on the next monthly bill. If you
make a lot of purchases, and keep your money in interest-bearing accounts until payment,
this can make you, over time, quite a bit of extra interest (though moreso during
periods when interest rates are a bit higher than they are now).</li>
 	<li>Cashback: Many credit card companies have programs whereby they give you back some
percentage (usually 1 to 1.5%) of the cost of your purchases to encourage you to use
the card more. If you make a lot of purchases, this can add up nicely.</li>
 	<li>Platinum benefits: If you have a platinum card (they're quite easy to get for free
if you have good credit), they come with a number of added benefits, such as supplemental
warranties for items purchased on the card, rental insurance for car rentals paid
for with the card, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Building a Credit Rating:</b> Using a credit card responsibly for some time builds
a credit rating, while using a debit card (or paying cash) doesn't. This is useful
if you plan at some point to take out loans of any sort (whether to buy a car, mortgage
a house, or start a business).</li>
</ul>
In short, a credit card does not have to be expensive, or put you in debt, or any
of the other normally negative connotations associated with it. When used properly,
essentially as a delayed debit card, it is entirely free, can have some side benefits,
and gives me a greater feeling of safety -- the process of "charge things on the card,
then review the bill, then pay it if nothing is amiss" strikes me as safer than the
process of "charge things on the card, then review the list of debits, then try to
get my money back if something is amiss."
