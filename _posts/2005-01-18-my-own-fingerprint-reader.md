<P><SPAN>Guess what I'm using to blog this entry with? My very own Microsoft Optical Desktop with Fingerprint reader! I've been using the fingerprint reader to sign into a number of my favorite web sites as well as desktop applications and boy do I love it. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>For those of you who can remember I blogged about this last November but never did I imagine that I would using it so soon. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>I was able to afford this thanks to Microsoft and the $150 voucher I got use at the Microsoft company store.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Two things I'm disappointed with though is that I'm not able to login to Windows itself using the fingerprint reader as it's not enabled on a domain login. I'm guessing this is because of some security requirements, I wonder if there is a hack to get it working. The second disappointment and one that I waste a lot of time on is signing in to remote machines using Remote Desktop. Here too the fingerprint reader fails, guess both of them are related though.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Although there is a lot of talk about the tilt feature in optical mouse, I haven't found it that useful yet. Maybe it takes time to grown on you or I've not been using any windows with horizontal scrollbars today. But the wireless mouse is really cool. I'll post pics of my desktop as soon as take a few snaps with Ashan's camera.</SPAN></P></DIV>
