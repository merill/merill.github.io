What's the easiest way to break into the debugger in JavaScript especially when you have heaps of js files being loaded by a page (SharePoint 2013 &amp; display templates, I'm looking at you)
Apparently this is a very old trick (pre 2006). Just add the debugger command (and enable script debugging if your using IE).
