<p>Yesterday I was excited when I could download the Win 7 dev kit, but that turned to disappointment when I realised that I could only run the application that I deployed and not try out the other stuff on the phone.</p>  <p>Today, thanks to Dan Ardelean I was able to <a href="http://sviluppomobile.blogspot.com/2010/03/wmp7-emulator-unlock.html">unlock the Windows 7 Phone emulator</a>. So here I was poking around only to be pleasantly surprised to see the SharePoint client built in to the phone.</p>  <p>Here are the first screenshots you’ll see of the Win7Phone SharePoint client. </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="SharePointWorkspace" border="0" alt="SharePointWorkspace" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SharePointWorkspace.png" width="398" height="768" /> </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="MySiteLinks" border="0" alt="MySiteLinks" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MySiteLinks.png" width="374" height="725" /> </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="SharePoint Client" border="0" alt="SharePoint Client" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SharePointClient.png" width="374" height="727" /></p>
