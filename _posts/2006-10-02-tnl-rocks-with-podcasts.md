<P>Last weekend I heard about the podcast while listening to the radio. Somewhere at TNL is a geek whose into some really wicked cool stuff. The station that pioneered internet broadcasting now offers podcasts at&nbsp;<A href="http://www.tnlpodcast.com/">http://www.tnlpodcast.com/</A>. </P>
<P>Whatâ€™s better&nbsp;is that my favorite radio station is powered by my favorite platform.</P>
<P>.NET rocks and so does TNL 101.7!</P>

<P>I dunno if it is the WMP 11 Beta, but the audio played super fast sounding mostly like Alvin of the Chipmunks.</P>
