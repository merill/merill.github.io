The greatest thing about tomorrow is, I will be better than I am today. And that's how I look at my life. I will be better as a golfer, I will be better as a person, I will be better as a father, I will be a better husband, I will be better as a friend. That's the beauty of tomorrow. There is no such thing as a setback. The lessons I learn today I will apply tomorrow, and I will be better."</strong>  <p>—<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/columns/story?columnist=diaz_jaime&amp;id=3158267">Tiger Woods</a></p>
