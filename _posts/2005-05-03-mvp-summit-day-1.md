<p>There was one particular event on Day 1 that I can safely say wasn't under NDA so I'm free to blog about it. </p>
<p>What do you think happens when 200 testosterone driven&nbsp;&lsquo;super geeks&rsquo; are entertained by some really sexy exotic dancers?</p>

<p>They go NUTS taking pictures without enjoying the actual show. Now, I wonder what they&rsquo;ll be doing later with those pictures&hellip;</p>
