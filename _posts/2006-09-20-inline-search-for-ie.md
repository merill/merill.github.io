<p>A feature that Firefox users have been enjoying all along finally comes to IE. Infact I was not happy when IE7 didn't include&nbsp;this feature&nbsp;and even now a search on <a href="http://www.ieaddons.com/">www.ieaddons.com</a> doesn't turn up any results.</p>
<p>There is one though at <a href="http://www.core-services.fr/inline-search/">http://www.core-services.fr/inline-search/</a>&nbsp;go get it.</p>
