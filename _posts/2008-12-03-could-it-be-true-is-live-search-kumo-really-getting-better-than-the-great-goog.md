<p>So I wanted to find a tool that would do fast folder comparisons. Searching on Google gave me a lot of useless stuff most of them related to fast folder access or folder comparison but not ‘fast folder comparison’.</p>  <p>On a whim I switched live.com and lo and behold I was presented with UltraCompare in the search results with this to say:</p>  <p><em>Save time by performing an extremely <strong>fast</strong> <strong>folder</strong> <strong>comparison</strong> using just the sizes and timestamps of corresponding files.</em></p>  <p>Even a quoted search for “fast folder comparison” returns 8 results in Live but just 2 in Google.</p>  <p>Will I switch to Live search? No.</p>  <p>But something to keep in mind when I’m not getting the results I want on Google.</p>  <p>BTW: The Google Search Wiki is certainly intriguing. I totally dig neat Ajax stuff.</p>  <p><img title="GooglePromote" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="92" alt="GooglePromote" src="http://www.merill.net/wp-content/uploads/files/WindowsLiveWriter/CoulditbetrueIsLiveSearchKumoreallygetti_9F9D/GooglePromote_1.jpg" width="556" border="0" /></p>
