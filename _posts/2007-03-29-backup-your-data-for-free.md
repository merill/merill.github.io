<P>I ran across this on ScottH's <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OnLosingDataAndAFamilyBackupStrategy.aspx">post</A> today. The&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mozy.com">Mozy.com</A> gives you 2GB of backup storage&nbsp;for free. </P>
<P>Currently, I use the free <A href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback">SyncBack</A>&nbsp;utility to backup the stuff to an extra hard-drive on&nbsp;the local machine. I've thought of using <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMail_Drive">GMail Drive</A> as a remote backup option but&nbsp;then I would have had to&nbsp;muck around with all the syncing. Plus it's basically a hack with the 10MB and .zip/.exe blocking limitations of GMail.</P>
<P>Mozy on the other hand makes it all a breeze! The initial setup identified all my stuff like IE/Firefox favorites, contacts and email, My Documents, Visual Studio projects, the list goes on. I can also set when it should sync and how much bandwidth it should take etc. Cool!</P>
