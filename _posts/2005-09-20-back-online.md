<p>Ahh.. Feels so sweet to be back online. My hosting server got screwed up and 
I had to wait till Madura got back to work to fix it up. Weirdly, all that was 
needed was to just start up the IIS service. Grr... why didn't I look into 
that.</p>
<p>Lot's of stuff has been happening since I was offline. The Tech.Ed site (<a href="http://www.teched.lk">www.teched.lk</a>) went live, registrations have now 
opened for Tech.Ed. Loads of very, very cool stuff planned. Even more loads of 
giveaways. Boy, this is going to be a whole lot of geek goodness.</p>
<p>I just found out from Madura that <a href="http://kavinda.net/">Kavinda</a> 
left for Boston in the morning today and I was thinking that he was leaving 
tonight. Hope he finds time to blog from there.</p>
<p>My cousin brother Tarin got married week before last (my brother and I were 
the 'best-men'), the count-down to my wedding has started (that's right folks 
Jan 28th '06 is my D-Day).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/asia/developer/team3.asp">Ed</a> was down 
here last week for a couple of days&nbsp;and spent a whole day with me taking me 
through all the stuff that I should know about as a Developer Evangelist. I keep 
pinching myself that I am now a Microsoftee and a Developer Evangelist at that 
too. What can I say, I'm super excited!</p>
