I was reading this old series of posts on the whole <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/04/05/568947.aspx">Office Ribbon bar design</a> (quite a fascinating from a developer perspective). I came across the comments where quite a few have ranted on the &#39;paste unformatted text&#39; as being more preferred than paste. I too used to be in that same group but that was before I came across this whole section dedicated to configuring copy-paste under the Advanced tab in Word options. Here you can configure the default paste action. For keyboard freaks there&#39;s always the Alt+H, V, S to get to the Paste dialog.

While we&#39;re on the topic of Copy/Paste. Do yourself a favor and install <a href="http://bluemars.org/clipx/">ClipX</a>, you have absolutely no idea what your missing.
