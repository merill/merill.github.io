<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe">Dan Fernandez</a> has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/06/14/429092.aspx">posted</a> about <a href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/jlowy/">Juval Lowy&rsquo;s</a> My wrapper for C#. What&rsquo;s hilarious is the name that Juval is using for the wrapper. Here&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p><em>The naming convention being that when VB refers to "itself" it uses the keyword "Me" and when C# refers to itself it "this", then logically when referring to something else, VB will use "My" and C# will use "That". VB being "Me" and "My", C# being "this" and "That".</em></p>
