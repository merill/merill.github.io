<p><img alt="twitter" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/binary/Twitter_7A06/twitter.gif"> </p> <p>I just tried <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>&nbsp;last week and was blown away! This is one really really cool service.</p> <p>For&nbsp;me the coolest part about it is the SMS/Texting feature. For those who haven't used it yet, think of&nbsp;it as a service which lets you&nbsp;SMS/Text all&nbsp;your friends by sending an SMS to just a single number that twitter gives.</p> <p>Twitter then goes out and updates everyone on your list by sending them SMS plus updating a whole lot of other&nbsp;places like your Facebook profile, your blog...</p> <p>Other features include sending the message from the Twitter website or even from a downloadable app (imagine that FREE SMS), if you want to you can send a message to just one friend.</p> <p>Note to Sri Lankan users,&nbsp;this works find on Dialog but a few of my friends on Mobitel had trouble getting setup. If any of you get this working with Mobitel please let me know.</p> <p>Once you have created a twitter account go to <a href="http://twitter.com/merill">http://twitter.com/merill</a> and 'follow me' to get my twitter updates.&nbsp;</p>
