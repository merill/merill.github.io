<P class=MsoNormal>Dammika forwarded a link to this <A href="http://sl.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2004/AUG/024931_23YARDS_16AUG2004.html">article</A> on Murali, a must read for anyone who as an opinion on Murali&#8217;s bowling action. I would love to see the documentary on him that was shown on Channel 5 (or has it been already shown?).</P>
