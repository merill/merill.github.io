<p>I've been playing with uploading videos today and <a href="http://video.msn.com/">MSN Video</a> seems to outshine the other when it comes to uploading as well as viewing video.</p> <p>The biggest strength being the uploader that comes built in to <a href="http://get.live.com/photogallery/overview">Windows Live Photo Gallery</a>. With <a href="http://get.live.com/photogallery/overview">YouTube</a> you need to wait for the whole video to upload which can take quite a lot of time, if not you need to muck around with some compression program and fine-tune the settings before doing the upload. I don't have the patience for that.</p> <p>The Photo Gallery uploader seems to compress the file as it uploads making it extremely fast.</p> <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="449" alt="PublishVideoOnSoapbox" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/binary/UploadingVideos_DC09/PublishVideoOnSoapbox.png" width="659" border="0"></p> <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="264" alt="UploadingToSoapbox" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/binary/UploadingVideos_DC09/UploadingToSoapbox.png" width="548" border="0">&nbsp; </p> <p>Then Windows Live Writer makes it as easy as Insert-&gt;Video to allow you to pick the video that you uploaded.</p> <p><img height="588" alt="Insert Video" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/binary/UploadingVideos_DC09/InsertVideo.png" width="498" border="0"></p>
