<p>Dammika wanted to know where the hell I was. Things have been pretty hectic for me since I landed in Colombo last Tuesday morning. </p>
<p>Let me see&hellip; On Tuesday I went back to office for our weekly conference call, Wednesday I had to go to Mizra&rsquo;s birthday party (Imara&rsquo;s bro), Thursday back at work again, Friday work, badminton, Chalani&rsquo;s wedding. Saturday went to Kandy to bring back my car. Sunday shifted houses, I now live at Thalawatugoda with the Sonnadara brothers.&nbsp;We also went out to MIT and had a cool swim to relax off the weekend!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun with my new camera. This is a pic from Chalani&rsquo;s wedding with Madura, Dishnika, Ashan and me at the top trying to place a horn on Dish <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/smile3.gif" /></p>
