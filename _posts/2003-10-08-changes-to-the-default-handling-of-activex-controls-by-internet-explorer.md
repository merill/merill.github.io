    <p>
        All you developers who have created sites that use ActiveX controls need to know this. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to a recent lawsuit against Microsoft, changes are going to be made to IE6 so
        that it displays a message to the user before showing ActiveX controls on the page.
        This includes most pages with Flash content and other ActiveX controls. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft is giving a pre-release version of IE6 that you can download and test your
        pages to see how the site will look in the new IE. There are workarounds that you
        can do too such as using JavaScript to load the controls from a script. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To download the pre-release and for the workarounds visit <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/</a>.
        Note that you can have your current IE&#160;version as well as the new version running
        on your machine at the same&#160;time. 
    </p>
