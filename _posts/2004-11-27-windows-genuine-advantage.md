<p class=MsoNormal>I got my first taste of the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/offers/default.aspx?displaylang=en">Windows
Genuine Advantage</a> today. I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot about Photo Story 3
on the web lately so I thought I&#8217;d give it a try. The download was pretty
painless with a link to the 5MB msi file right off the product home page. But trying
to install it simply said something to the effect that I needed the Windows
Genuine Advantage and no mention of how to go about getting it (even though I did
have a genuine Windows XP license on my machine). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being the clever IT pro I was I clicked on a banner image
that talked about the Windows Genuine Advantage which then took through
installing an ActiveX control and then prompting for my serial key and then
authenticated that I had a genuine installation. After this I was able to run
the setup and install Photo Story. The fact is that this is a pretty convoluted
process of authenticating and installing and I don&#8217;t think a typical home
user would be able to complete what I did.</p>
