<P>Follow the steps that I’ve outlined in my last years post&nbsp;‘<A href="http://www.merill.net/AddSriLankanHolidaysToYourOutlookCalendar.aspx">Add Sri Lankan holidays to your Outlook calendar</A>’. The same steps work on Outlook 2007 as well.</P>
<P>I’ve updated this year’s list to include whether each holiday is a B. P. or M.</P>
<P>Note that if you have last year’s list under Sri Lanka you will need to replace it with this year’s ones. I can’t quite imagine why this thing is not easier.</P>
<P>[UPDATE: The box parenthises were causing problems. I've changed them now. Thanks <A href="http://sandarenu.blogspot.com/">Sandarenu</A>.]</P>
