<p>My brother and sister teamed up to buy me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007KQUP2?v=glance">this</a>, so to return the favor I bought Julius (my small bro) one heck of an MP3 player. I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00066EK2W/ref=pd_sbs_e_1/002-1916546-3057637?v=glance&amp;s=electronics">SanDisk 1GB</a>&nbsp;player from Amazon and I feared that the sound quality poor.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to hook it up to my machine and copy my files over. My first surprise was how fast the copy went when compared with the Creative Muvo that Microsoft gave us MVPs. The second surprise was that this sounded better than the Muvo. Man am I envious now, my 128MB feels really cheap compared to the 1GB player (FM tuner included). Well, at least I get to use it on my long lay-overs on the way back to Colombo.</p>
