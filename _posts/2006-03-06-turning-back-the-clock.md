<p>This <a href="http://www.asiantribune.com/show_news.php?id=17251">turning the clock around</a> thingy is becoming a fashion statement that every Sri Lankan President wants to do. Right now its Mahinda mamaa&rsquo;s turn and he wants us to go back by 30 minutes. This way we go into the same timezone as that in the LTTE controlled areas as well as India&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer the time as it is now since I get to work early and have more daylight in the evenings. What I&rsquo;m interested in finding out is whether there will be a Windows patch to change the timezone or if we&rsquo;ll need to wait till Vista is out.</p>
<p>We do live in interesting if not wierd times.</p>
