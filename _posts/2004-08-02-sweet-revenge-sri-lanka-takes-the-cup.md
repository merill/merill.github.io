  go Sri Lanka! I wasn&#8217;t able to make it to watch the match but watched
  it on a large projection screen at the Fingara club with some friends. Man
  did the Indian&#8217;s self-destruct, Sachin couldn&#8217;t have played any
  worse than yesterday even if he had tried.</span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>All
  credit to the Sri Lankan&#8217;s for playing positively even though they didn&#8217;t
  have a large score to defend. Let&#8217;s hope our guys can be on top of
  South Africa as well in the coming weeks.</span></p>
