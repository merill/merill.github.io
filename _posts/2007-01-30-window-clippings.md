<P>I take a lot of screenshots and Vista posed a problem with it's window shadows. My workaround was to place the screen behind a Notepad background before taking the screenshot.</P>
<P>Enter <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2007/01/28/window-clippings-1-5.aspx">Window Clippings</A> from Kenny Kerr, includes taking the shadow background and supports a whole lot of formats including smaller file sizes with .png</P>
<P>The Snipping Tool in Vista just got retired.</P>
