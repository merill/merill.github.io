<p>Thanks a lot for all the positive feedback I&rsquo;ve been hearing from you guys on yesterday&rsquo;s presentation. I need to make a public apology to <a href="http://manzi.wordpress.com/">Manzi</a>&nbsp;though, sorry man for cutting into your presentation time. </p>
<p>As promised you can download the <a href="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/NET%203.0%201%20Hour%20Overview.ppt">.NET 3.0 Overview Presentation</a> [10MB]. Ed saved my day but had to fight the devil himself to get this presentation across to me.</p>
<p>Julie Lerman has a <a href="http://blog.ziffdavis.com/devlife/archive/2006/10/01/43487.aspx">good post</a> that clarifies .NET roadmap and word soup. If you missed my session yesterday check out the video of a similar session from Tech.Ed Australia at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charles_sterling/archive/2006/09/11/749226.aspx">Charles Strelings&rsquo;s blog</a>. I spent a whole night poring through the presentation to figure out the demo script and I&rsquo;m glad you all enjoyed it.</p>
<p>FYI: The official .NET Framework 3.0 site is at <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/">www.netfx3.com</a></p>
