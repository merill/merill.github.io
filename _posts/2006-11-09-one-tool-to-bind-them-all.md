<p>Or just two on this occassion. But man what a tool, Filemon and Regmon have been mashed-up into <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/processesandthreads/processmonitor.mspx">one</a>. Better yet not just a mashup it has been written from the ground up and includes a number of enhancements.</p>
