<p><a href="http://thedeveloper.blogspot.com/">Prasanna&rsquo;s</a> session on <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org/">NHibernate</a> at this month&rsquo;s user group meeting was a really cool eye opener into the world of ORM. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about Hibernate never truly realized that it was fast becoming so popular and is now taking on heavyweights like EJBs. </p>
<p>With ObjectSpaces looking more like a distant dream, NHibernate is for the here and now. <a href="http://thedeveloper.blogspot.com/">Prasanna</a> did a&nbsp;really super job in explaining the concepts as well as getting down the nitty gritty and walking us through code demos to show how a refined object oriented architecture can be used to build Enterprise apps. Kudos to him!</p>
<p>Get the slides and the demo from <a href="http://thedeveloper.blogspot.com/2005/04/april-net-user-group-meeting.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, since our first anniversary of the .NET User Group is coming up in a couple of months we were planning on holding some sort of tournament that all our user group member could take part in. A lot of ideas were bandied about and we&rsquo;re now choosing between a six-a-side cricket tournament or an indoor cricket tournament. What do you guys think?</p>
