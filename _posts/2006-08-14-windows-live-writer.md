<p>Microsoft just released Windows Live Writer today and I'm guessing this is going to replace BlogJet as my default editor. <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi">Get it here</a>.</p> <p>Just a quick summary of the features:</p> <ul> <li>Works with all great blog tools</li> <li>WYSIWYG (literally), this is done by downloading your style/theme. Your editor shows up just like your actual blog</li> <li>Uploading pictures (wow, just noticed that it has cool effects to apply, like the drop shadow you see below)Auto saving of posts (no more lost ones)</li> <li>more than one account to blog to (alas doesn't support the Group Posting that BlogJet has - the only con)</li> <li>Did I mention that it is FREE!</li></ul> <p><a href="https://merill.net/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/bca2973c9e53_67A4/WindowsLiveWriter8.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="428" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/bca2973c9e53_67A4/WindowsLiveWriter_thumb6.jpg" width="640" border="0"></a></p>
