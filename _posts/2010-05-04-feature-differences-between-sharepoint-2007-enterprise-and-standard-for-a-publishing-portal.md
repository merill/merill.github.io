I recently had to deploy a site template that was built using SharePoint Enterprise Edition 2007 on an instance of SharePoint Standard Edition 2007.

Obviously given that some features were not available in the Standard Edition I received the 'The template you have chosen is invalid or cannot be found'. Unlike a <a href="http://www.sharepointconfig.com/2007/05/moss-site-templates-not-compatible-with-wss/">MOSS to WSS conversion</a> the problem here is that the features do exist on the server but are simply not available for the standard edition.

I basically resorted to manually comparing the differences between a site template created in the Standard edition vs one created in the Enterprise edition.

Here's the list if anyone ever needs this.

Remove these features from a template created in the Enterprise edition if you want to deploy it on a Standard edition. Obviously you need to test to ensure that your template is not actually using any of the Enterprise features.
